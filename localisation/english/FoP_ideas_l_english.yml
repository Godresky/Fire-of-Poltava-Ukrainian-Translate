 AFU_strikes:0 "National Strikes"
 AFU_strikes_desc:0 "As we expected, the tightening of quotas has only angered the already dissatisfied people more. Not only are there protests in major cities almost every day, but workers are going on strike en masse and people are generally not even bothering with curfews. If this continues, production will simply shut down, and even the army will not help. We need to act while we still can, and this is where the sugar and whip method comes in handy..."
 AFU_ssojaitsa:0 "SSO"
 AFU_ssojaitsa_desc:0 "The Special Operations Forces (SSO) are the most elite part of the Armed Forces. All soldiers in these units represent the pinnacle of our military's skills. The intelligence and other specialists present in their ranks also make them indispensable, expanding the range of their application. Despite their affiliation with the Armed Forces, they are also used as a professional substitute for the national police, and are involved in anti-terrorist operations and law enforcement. In short, the SSO can deal with, as Petliura used to say, "Muscovite lice" and "Ukrainian nits"."
 AFU_martial_law: "Воєнний стан"
 AFU_martial_law_desc:0 "After a sudden attack from the other side of the demarcation line, it became clear that sooner or later the frozen conflict in Donbas could flare up. Therefore, martial law was enforced in the government-controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Although martial law places a burden on the regional economy and local population, it is crucial for maintaining order in our territories. However, as the situation in Ukraine is slowly deteriorating, we cannot be sure how long we will be able to maintain it, as these trends are getting worse every day."
 AFU_after_victory:0 "The Price of Victory"
 AFU_after_victory_desc:0 "Though the last dust of the war has settled, the consequences do not disappear immediately. A big part of Donbass is still hostile towards Ukrainian administration  - that's what you get after more than 5 years of non-stop Russian propaganda in a troubled, war-torn region. And while the integrational measures, both minor and major, were already started, it may take time to get back on track from such a drastic change..."
 AFU_filtration:0 "Filtration"
 AFU_filtration_desc:0 "Sadly for the Provisional Government, the majority of the population still is on good terms with Russia and pledge allegiance to what used to be the separatist government. Recently, a small repressive measure was enforced - from now on, anyone who vocally takes the Russian side will get interrogated and persecuted, that's the only way to bring order to Donbass..."
 industrial_legacy: "Промисловий спадок"
 industrial_legacy_desc:0 "Since the first half of the 20th century, the Donbas industrial area has been and remains the most developed region of Ukraine - during the times of the Russian Empire, the USSR and modern Ukraine. Centred largely around coal mines and steel mills, it became the backbone of the region's economy. However, due to mismanagement during the Soviet era, highly unfair privatisation and corruption in independent Ukraine, it has become a shell of its former self, with backward industrial technology and a depressed post-industrial region similar to the North of England in the UK, which has lost much of its huge economic potential over time, with coal mines becoming unprofitable. Following the pro-Russian uprisings in 2014, most of these assets fell under the control of the unrecognised republics and were subsequently seized and taken to the Russian Federation, leaving the region in a dire situation." 
 AFU_pro_russian_sentiments: "Промосковські настрої"
 AFU_pro_russian_sentiments_desc:0 "In many of Ukraine's southeastern regions since independence, a large proportion of the population has been sympathetic to Russia, with Luhansk and Donetsk regions being more so than elsewhere. Due to the Soviet policy of Russification and the Holodomor of the 1930s, as well as urbanisation and Russian labour migration, the region has been heavily influenced by Russia. As a result, even after the pro-Russian uprisings and their failure to prove an alternative to a "better life" under Russian rule, the two areas controlled by Ukraine have always voted for pro-Russian parties such as the OPZZh. While the problem may be somewhat exaggerated, there are still people who would support Russian rule over Ukrainian."
 AFU_nationalist_agendas: "Вплив правих сил"
 AFU_nationalist_agendas_desc:0 "During the pro-Russian uprisings in the east in 2014, many Ukrainian patriots and others who cared about Ukraine's independence volunteered to fight on the frontlines in the Donbas, subsequently playing an important role in deterring Russia's advance westwards. The best known and most prominent volunteer unit is the Azov battalion. Formed by far-right football fans, it has taken part in the defence of Ukraine and has become an integral part of our Armed Forces. Although some left-wing and liberal journalists question their ideology, most Ukrainians, even some pro-Russian ones, support them."
 AFU_apathy_of_the_population: "Апатія населення"
 AFU_apathy_of_the_population_desc:0 "A bit like the Russians, Donbas residents on both sides of the conflict feel apathetic about the political situation in the region. "Just leave us alone" is what many people in these areas would say. These people make up the majority of the population, which is predominantly middle-aged and elderly. This could be a problem, as due to their apolitical nature, this majority would prefer not to be involved in a potential escalation of the conflict."
 AFU_disorganised_administration: "Дезорганізована адміністрація"
 AFU_disorganised_administration_desc:0 "After the loss of power of the central authority in Kyjiv over Donets'k and Luhans'k oblasts, we came into trouble administering the area. Fixing it would be a matter of time, but it will surely complicate the lives of our citizens and work for our bureaucrats."
 AFU_continue_the_state_of_emergency:0 "Continuation of the State of Emergency"
 AFU_continue_the_state_of_emergency_desc:0 "There is no need for the Armed Forces to lift the state of emergency, at least for now. Although this is an unpopular decision among the population, almost everyone understands its necessity. The army will use the state of emergency to put its affairs in order, perhaps even trying to bring its situation out of the "hopeless" status"
 AFU_improved_training_methods:0 "Improved Training Methods"
 AFU_improved_training_methods_desc:0 "After careful consideration, the Armed Forces have chosen to improve the quality of their troops. The training programmes now take more time and resources, but it pays off with almost elite troops who are ready for a tough battle!"
 AFU_broader_training_plan:0 "Broader Training Plan"
 AFU_broader_training_plan_desc:0 "The army's reliance on militias, while not a very popular choice, was understandable. Both in the past and in the present, militias have proven to be an effective tool in the fight for Ukrainian independence. Despite a significant loss in quality, this new method is far superior in quantity, which may be exactly what the Armed Forces need now."
 AFU_millitary_administration:0 "Millitary Administration"
 AFU_millitary_administration_desc:0 "What used to be a chaotic bunch of army groups waiting for orders from the capital has now become a functional, self-sufficient military machine! Ukraine's Armed Forces can now fully manage their own affairs, both military and civilian, without needing any orders - they already know what to do."
 AFU_defensive_strategy:0 "Defensive Strategy"
 AFU_defensive_strategy_desc:0 "The Armed Forces have now adapted their defence strategy. Regardless of what they plan to do next, they do not want to repeat the mistakes of the previous separatist offensive and have prepared in advance."
 AFU_ce_baza_ce_genshtab:0 "Improved General Staff"
 AFU_ce_baza_ce_genshtab_desc:0 "The high command of the Armed Forces agreed to reform the General Staff to make it more responsive to the demands of the times and to improve the effectiveness of army management. Many generals have left their posts, leaving them to young and ambitious officers who are enthusiastic about implementing their own methods of warfare."
 AFU_ready_military:0 "Ready Millitary"
 AFU_ready_military_desc:0 "The General Staff, judging by their actions, has made sure that their troops will never again be subjected to surprise attacks. Any move by the separatists is a move they expect. A step to which they already know how to respond."
 AFU_local_arms_manufacturing:0 "Local arms manufacturing"
 AFU_local_arms_manufacturing_desc:0 "Donbas is an industrial-rich region, so the Armed Forces decided to make the most of their situation. Factories, sometimes not even intended for military production, have finally been rebuilt and put into operation. Now, while their rivals are desperately looking for weapons, they can arm themselves!"
 AFU_support_UKR:0 "Support from Kyjiv"
 AFU_support_UKR_desc:0 "De jure, the Armed Forces of Ukraine still function as part of the old Ukrainian regime and are therefore loyal to Kyiv. Formally, this makes everything they receive from the capital not "aid" but "delayed delivery packages"."
 AFU_support_PRH:0 "Suport from Poroshenko"
 AFU_support_PRH_desc:0 "As expected, the "rogue president" agreed to supply the AFU. Whether it is to really help the army or to increase his own legitimacy in the eyes of the people, the fact remains that the aid is there, it is there and it is getting to the frontline - nothing else matters."
 AFU_bezlad:0 "Bezlad"
 AFU_bezlad_desc:0 "Although the main threat has passed, the work, even in this region, is far from over. The incredible number of unresolved bureaucratic issues, the huge pro-separatist sentiment among the population, the urgent need to rebuild cities - all these painful scars need to be healed, otherwise the entire Interim Government will rot from within. Chas rozibraty tsej bezlad!"
 AFU_nationalist_agendas_2:0 "Nationalist Agendas"
 AFU_nationalist_agendas_2_desc:0 "Since the decision to denounce far-right elements within Armed Forces ranks, it would appear that nothing quite changed. "Azov" is still there, far-right soldiers were not fired, all the same, right? The real change is almost invisible. High command simply made them all a bit more quiet, cracking on the spread, not on the individuals. As of now, without proper propaganda, hardline nationalism in the army simply fades away, barely leaving a long-term trace."

 ZAK_hungarian_influence:0 "Hungarian Influence"
 ZAK_hungarian_influence_desc:0 "It is no secret that there are many ethnic Hungarians living in Transcarpathia. This might not seem like a big deal, but for the regional authorities it has become a serious threat to their still stable rule. The Hungarians vote for the same politicians, seek their own rights and autonomy, and some even publicly beg Hungary to "intervene" and "save them"."
 ZAK_local_security_service:0 "Local Security Service"
 ZAK_local_security_service_desc:0 "Of all the "governments" across Ukraine, the best place for the security service would undoubtedly be Transcarpathia. When everything collapsed, most of the security forces were temporarily relocated there because it was a "relatively stable region", pending further instructions from Kyiv. But now the capital is out of reach, so the security forces operate on a regional scale, with loyalty to Uzhhorod."
 ZAK_svynohryusyny:0 "Rusyn Riots"
 ZAK_svynohryusyny_desc:0 "Today, Rusyns are a largely extinct ethnic group. The people and their culture have long been subjected to assimilation processes in Poland and Slovakia, and Ukrainian Transcarpathia was no exception. But when the collapse began, those who still call themselves "Rusyns" began mass protests for their linguistic and cultural autonomy"
 centre_of_the_ukrainian_nationalism:0 "Centre of the Ukrainian Nationalism"
 centre_of_the_ukrainian_nationalism_desc:0 "Since its founding, Lviv has played an important role in Ukrainian history and has been an important stronghold of Ukrainian culture. In modern times, the Ukrainian West was the crown of pure Ukrainian nationalism, and L'viv was its greatest pearl. After the collapse of the USSR, Galicia inherited this status and led the patriots on their own path."
 chornovils_model:0 "Chornovils Model"
 chornovils_model_desc:0 "Vyacheslav Chornovil was the greatest president... Ukraine could ever have. His life, suddenly cut short by a suspicious car accident in 1999, was filled with many political decisions that had one thing in common: patriotism. His views on what Ukraine should be like were, as many said, "what the country needed at the time" - free market capitalism, rapprochement with the West and federalisation. Galicia adopted his ways and views on governance in an attempt to rectify what they saw as a great Ukrainian tragedy - the defeat of Vyacheslav Chornovil in the 1991 elections."
 labour_emergency_crysis:0 "Labour Emergency Crysis"
 labour_emergency_crysis_desc:0 "Although emigration to Poland and the EU was a common Ukrainian practice even in better times, the collapse has dramatically increased the number of emigrants willing to leave the hot spot that Ukraine has unfortunately become."
 TER_pagan_fanaticism:0 "Pagan Fanatism"
 TER_pagan_fanaticism_desc:0 "No matter how low the support for paganism in the region, those who are actually "believers" would fight with amazing devotion. They would not hesitate to go into battle with their bare hands if they knew that their odd gods would be pleased."
 TER_unpopular_movement:0 "Unpopular Movement"
 TER_unpopular_movement_desc:0 "The reason why the pagans have this region at all is hardly clear to those who live there. The whole thing was just a sequence of absurd Kafkaesque events - nothing more than a pagan festival gone wrong. One thing happened after another, and now crazy people with even crazier gods rule their hometowns. And these madmen want more."
 KHM_good_climate_for_investments:0 "Good Climate for Investments"
 KHM_good_climate_for_investments_desc:0 "The Khmelnytsky region has been a pretty good place to invest recently. The region's relative security, business relocation and geographical location next to the UN Office in Bukovyna have kept the local authorities happily making money, at least for now."
 KHM_nuclear_power_plant:0 "Nuclear Power Plant"
 KHM_nuclear_power_plant_desc:0 "The collapse of Ukraine did not mean anything to the operators of the nuclear power plant, so they continued to work on it despite the low level of state funding. The plant currently has 2 reactors, one of which produces 1000 MW of electricity. The plant is under the protection of the IAEA."
 RIV_nuclear_power_plant:0 "Nuclear Power Plant"
 RIV_nuclear_power_plant_desc:0 "The old nuclear power plant has been in operation for a long time, and the breakup of Ukraine will not change this. It has 4 reactors, each of which produces a different amount of electricity: Unit 1 produces 381 MW, Unit 2 - 376 MW, and the newest reactors produce 950 MW. The plant's safety is guaranteed by the IAEA."
 VOL_crush_the_bandits:0 "Bandits"
 VOL_crush_the_bandits_desc:0 "Perhaps the most pressing problem facing the Volyn authorities is banditry in the east. Not only do people want to be free, but the criminals themselves are severely undermining the region's economy. Lutsenko announces a "pacification campaign" against illegal amber smugglers to put an end to their "business" once and for all."
 romanian_millitary_administration:0 "Romanian Millitary Administration"
 romanian_millitary_administration_desc:0 "The Bukovyna administration was created as part of a UN peacekeeping mission after Romania officially requested an international mandate because "Romanians in the region need to be rescued from the mess that is happening in Ukraine". Given this fact, many Eastern politicians are already calling it a "Romanian invasion" and a "violation of the non-interference rule"."
 ZHY_unfulfilled_promises:0 "Unfulfilled Promises"
 ZHY_unfulfilled_promises_desc:0 "Perhaps throughout the history of independent Ukraine, politicians have fed the nation with promises. Promises, and more promises, promises to fulfil old promises, promises to fire those who do not fulfil their promises, and so on. The Socialist Republic was not too different from this classical tradition. People were promised peace, prosperity, power and rights, but instead they ended up almost where they started."
 ZHY_shaky_coalition:0 "Shaky Coalition"
 ZHY_shaky_coalition_desc:0 "The coalition between the Radical Party and Batkivshchyna was not really united. The question of how to dispose of the land they received has thrown an already uneasy alliance into a storm of instability. Every disagreement between the two parties is massively exploited by the coalition's opponents, but somehow the alliance holds together. No one knows for how long."
 ZHY_beginning_of_the_reforms:0 "The Beginning of Reforms"
 ZHY_beginning_of_the_reforms_desc:0 "It is fair to say that the Socialist Party government has started to do something, and this is indeed huge progress, given the circumstances. The long-term effect of their political, military and agricultural reforms remains to be seen, but people are simply hoping that the changes are real and not just another brick in the wall of promises"
 KYI_chernobyl_exclusion_zone:0 "Chernobyl Exclusion Zone"
 KYI_chernobyl_exclusion_zone_desc:0 "The well-known Chornobyl Exclusion Zone is in the hands of the independent government of the Kyiv region, but such an artefact requires maintenance costs. Patrols and security, scientific expeditions, containment measures and radiation monitoring all leave a significant mark on the regional budget."
 UKR_the_deluge: "Потоп"
 UKR_the_deluge_desc:0 "Everything is in the worst condition it can be. People are panicking, enemies are everywhere, the economy is in a miserable state, and the country is in ruins. Chaos surrounds Kyiv, with bandits and anarchists blocking the motorways, but this does not stop the brave souls trying to escape. The situation in the troubled city itself is not much better, with criminal and protest groups almost controlling entire neighbourhoods. Every second that the Ukrainian authorities waste is paid for by the grief of a people who have already suffered enough. People no longer want to fight for ideas like sovereignty or freedom, they just want to survive."
 UKR_unpopular_president: "Непопулярний президент"
 UKR_unpopular_president_desc:0 "It is not difficult to understand why Ukrainians do not like Zelenskyy. It's not even about the policies he planned to implement or anything related to that, he was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. He became president, and everything fell apart - this image is engraved in people's minds, and it will take a long time before it is erased..."

 UKR_president_office_influence: "Вплив «Офісу президента»"
 UKR_president_office_influence_desc:0 "During his election campaign, Zelenskyy promised to bring new faces to the Verkhovna Rada, and the main new face was, of course, his own. This turned out to be a terrible mistake, as all of the so-called "New faces" in the party turned out to be inexperienced people who knew little about politics or simply how to run a country effectively. Among these people, however, there were some who managed to gain considerable influence in the party. In the context of the collapse of law and order across Ukraine, the "President's Office" has managed to take advantage of the complete collapse of Volodymyr Zelenskyy's popularity to effectively sideline the president and run what is left of Ukraine in the shadows, at most completely undermining presidential power. Unofficially, they are called the "Kyjiv Trio" - Andriy Bohdan, Andriy Yermak and Oleh Tatarov - grey cardinals whose influence on the political scene is enormous. At any opportunity, they can easily remove the facade of lies that marks the end of Zelenskyy's formal rule."

 PRH_illegitimate_president_desc:0 "Poroshenko lost the 2019 elections. This is a fact. A fact that everyone seems to have accepted. Except for him. Him and his electorate. He was a man who could have retired in peace somewhere in the tropics, but he decided to fight for the presidency by force. He decided to light this Fire. Seeing the obvious results of the election, and especially the mess that Poroshenko subsequently caused, he is still perceived as illegitimate, a "rogue president" fighting for political survival."
 PRH_cons_forces_union:0 "Union of the right forces"
 PRH_cons_forces_union_desc:0 "While Volodymyr Zelenskyy is still considered a legitimate president in Kyiv, many consider Poroshenko a traitor to the Ukrainian nation. Due to his rather unstable position, he has been forced to make concessions and desperately seek allies. This led to the creation of a shaky and unsuccessful alliance between Poroshenko, Filaret, Yurchenko and Khodakovsky. This alliance is only opportunistic, as all parties are desperate for popular support. As soon as one of them gains even a small advantage over all the others, the shaky coalition is likely to collapse."
 PRH_poroh_sins:0 "Poroh Sins"
 PRH_poroh_sins_desc:0 "Not only was Poroshenko not a saintly president, but he was also widely known for his scandalous and corrupt behaviour. The chocolate scandals, coal scandals, Putin scandals, money laundering scandals are just the tip of the iceberg, and no one knows how much more lies beneath the surface of media coverage. Among ordinary people, he was known as a great friend of the oligarchs, especially since he was one of them, so during his presidency, as many said, he "made the rich richer and the poor poorer"."
 PLT_home_of_the_revolution:0 "Home of the Revolution"
 PLT_home_of_the_revolution_desc:0 "It all started here... The chaos in Poltava was the introduction to this whole collapse. Clashes between supporters of one president or another ended with the National Corps winning. Since then, the city has been in much lesser ruins than it once was, but people have not forgotten anything. For now, the physical and moral burden of the collapse is on the shoulders of Poltava's nationalists, whether they like it or not."
 PLT_unstable_position:0 "Unstable Position"
 PLT_unstable_position_desc:0 "Although Poltava is not as "east-oriented" as, for example, Donbas, radical nationalism still does not sit well with the locals.

 KRE_ukrnafta_primacy_desc:0 "If Kolomoisky had a hryvnia for each state-corporation that emerged after the breakup of Ukraine, he would have two hryvnias, which is not much, but it is strange that it happened twice. As a separatist state from the nationalists in Poltava, Kremenchuk was completely dependent on Ukrnafta, as the oil company had long been the dominant political and economic stronghold of the region, holding the city together at the cost of massive violations of workers' rights."
