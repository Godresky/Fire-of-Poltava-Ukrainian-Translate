 POLITICS_MEDVED_DESC:0 "Viktor Volodymyrovych Medvedchuk was born on August 7, 1954 in the village of Shana in the Krasnoyarsk Territory. His father was convicted on charges of collaboration with Ukrainian nationalists during the Second World War (in fact, he was a German collaborator and helped export Ukrainians as slaves to Germany) and exiled to Siberia, from which they managed to return 6 years after the birth of their son. In 1971, he graduated from the Boriv secondary school and tried to enter the Higher Police School, but was not accepted due to the defects of his father's biography. In 1972, he entered Kyiv State University at the Faculty of Law. After graduation, he was admitted to the Kyiv Bar Association. Despite his young age, he acted as a human rights defender at the trials of two Ukrainian dissidents - poets Vasyl Stus and Yuri Lytvyn. Both of his clients were accused and died in prison. He himself many times found them guilty and helped the investigation to get rid of them. In the 80s, he moved to Kyiv and from the beginning of the 90s was considered one of the most influential local businessmen. During this period, he becomes the head of the Ukrainian Credit Bank, heads the Kyiv football club "Dynamo", and also expands his business. At the same time, in 1994, he became the head of the Higher Qualification Commission of the Bar under the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. It was in the 1990s that Victor Medvedchuk consistently became close to the first president, Leonid Kravchuk, and then to his successor, Leonid Kuchma. During the years of Kuchma's rule, his political career took off. In 1997, he entered the parliament for the first time. In the 1999 elections, he headed the campaign headquarters of the current president, Kuchma. It is to him and to Surkis that Kuchma owes his re-election for a second term. In 2002, he headed the Administration of the President of Ukraine, after which he was called the "gray cardinal".\n He was an ardent opponent of the Orange Revolution and fully supported Yanukovych as a presidential candidate. In the same year, he got married to Putin, who became the godfather of his child. In 2012, he created the organization "Ukrainian Choice", which advocated the rejection of the European course and reorientation towards joining the Customs Union. During the seizure of Crimea, he was on the peninsula, but he flew to Switzerland on the first flight. In 2018, he joined Vadym Rabinovich's "For Life" party. In the last elections in the Verkhovna Rada, he entered the parliament on the lists of the joint platform of the OPZZh. In 2019, when the united Ukraine ceased to exist, the main headquarters of the OPZZH was located in the Kherson region. Medvedchuk himself was there.

Coming from a Jewish family, he obtained a law degree in 2000 at the Faculty of Law of the Kryvyi Rih Institute of Economics of the Kyiv University of Economics named after Vadym Hetman, but he never worked in the field. During his student years, he became interested in KVK, and over time created his own team - "Kvartal 95". In the Russian project, he also met his future wife and often toured Russia. In 2003, at the request of Kolomoisky's TV channel "1+1", Zelenskyi and the company held concerts with their best numbers, and invested money in their own project on the TV channel "Inter" - "Evening Quarter" and later the team "95th Quarter" grew into "Kvartal-95 Studio". In 2010, Zelenskyi became the general producer of "Inter", but later, in 2011 and again in 2012, he resigned from his position and signed a contract with "1+1". He did not take part in the Revolution of Dignity, but in 2014 he managed to speak out against the intention of the Ministry of Culture to create a list of persons from Russia who pose a threat to the national security of Ukraine. In 2015, the series of his authorship and with him in the main role - "Servant of the People" began to be released, in which he, as a Russian-speaking history teacher, becomes the president of Ukraine and carries out reforms for the benefit of the people. In 2017, his colleague Ivan Bakanov also registered a political party of the same name. In 2018, there were also statements from Volodymyr Oleksandrovych himself about his intentions to end the Russian-Ukrainian war in Donbas through negotiations with Russia, if he becomes President. The official statement regarding his intentions to run for the presidency came out in a rather unexpected form - during the New Year's appeal on the air of the 1+1 channel in 2019.\n After a large-scale election campaign, presidential debates and accusations of collaboration with the oligarch Kolomoisky, as well as crossing the Russian-Ukrainian border after the start of the war in Donbas, he still won over his main competitor, Petro Poroshenko. But Poroh was not going to put up with defeat, which led to the collapse of Ukrainian unity. Zelenskyi is a person with no experience in politics, but is currently a puppet of the "President's Office", which is now actually running the country. He is also the owner of a terrible reputation and who knows how long he can last..."
 POLITICS_POROH_DESC:0 "Petro Oleksiyovych Poroshenko, born on September 26, 1965 in Bolgrad, Odesa Oblast, does not really need to be introduced. In 1989 he graduated from KNU named after T.G. Shevchenko, majoring in "international economic relations". After studying, he was engaged in business, owned factories, media (in particular, Channel 5), banks. But his most famous asset has always been the "Roshen" corporation. In 1998, he became a People's Deputy for the first time as a member of the Social Democratic Party. In 2000, he left Social Democracy and created his own party - "Solidarity" (in the future - European Solidarity), which later became part of the "Party of Regional Revival" (later - Party of Regions), but he also left it after a year and a half. In 2005, he became the secretary of the National Security Council, in 2007, the chairman of the NBU council, and in 2009 even the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Petro was an active participant in the Revolution of Dignity, which in the future helped him a lot during the presidential elections to increase ratings. With the help of the oligarch Firtash, he and Klitschko chose their fields - Petro was to run for President and Vitaliy for mayor of Kyiv. In the end, both won the elections. 20 days after being elected to the post of head of state, he signed the Association Agreement with the European Union, which became the source of his future authority. During his term of office, large-scale military reforms were carried out, which significantly increased the decline of the Armed Forces in recent years. Laws regarding language, decommunization, the creation of the United Local Orthodox Church and, in 2017, even visa-free entry into the EU were also signed. But despite all the reforms, a lot of scandals were attached to his name. Connections with oligarchs, privatization of businesses, offshore accounts and much more destroyed the reputation of Poroh, which was reflected in the 2019 elections. In them, Poroshenko lost to Volodymyr Zelenskyi, but he was not going to put up with it. He declared the results illegitimate and clashes broke out in Poltava between his supporters and the police. After the intervention of the National Corps, there was no turning back.\n Meanwhile, Petro Poroshenko's press conference with his constituents is taking place in Chernihiv, and in the end, Poroshenko was declared the president. In Kyiv, of course, this was not accepted and an actual war began. And after Petro Oleksiyovych declared himself the only legitimate leader, alternative political centers began to form all over the country. But as it turned out later, Poroshenko had no real support in the regions he controlled. In order to maintain his status, he was forced to enter into alliance agreements with the local ultra-right, representatives of churches and other "marginals", but who knows, maybe he still has some tricks up his sleeve."

Before Collapse, he, together with his girlfriend, Juliana Zhovanik, made videos about cinema, games and sometimes politics. When Ukraine disintegrated, regional elections were held in Zaporizhzhia region, in which Shkrobinets was victorious thanks to the support of the pro-Ukrainian youth of Zaporizhzhia and Melitopol. It was these young people, with the consent of Oleksiy, who were to shape the future of this region.

 POLITICS_KOHULINSKY_DESC:0 ""Loyalty to the nation", these are the words that arise, or should arise in the minds of Ukrainians, when they hear the name of Ruslan Volodymyrovych Koshulynskyi. Born on September 9, 1969 in L'viv, young Ruslan, after graduating from school, a sports boarding school, being a conscript in the Soviet army in Germany and graduating from the technological faculty of the Cooperative Technical College in L'viv, became a production manager at the restaurant-hotel "Berkut" in the Hutsul region. In 1996, after working in Krasnoyarsk Krai, he joined SNPU (later the All-Ukrainian Association "Svoboda") and 10 years later received a bachelor's degree in "Law" at Ternopil Technical University. Since 2008, he held key positions in the party and from 2012 to 2014 became a People's Deputy. Took an active part in the Revolution of Dignity and in all the most important events of that time. On February 20, 2014, Ruslan, at that time the only legitimate representative of the government in the country, on his own initiative, gathered people's deputies to a meeting of the Verkhovna Rada in order to stop the bloodshed. That day, at Koshulynskyi's suggestion, the deputies voted to remove Yanukovych from power and return "Berkut" to their places of deployment. The decisions made at that meeting of the Verkhovna Rada became the basis for the world community to recognize the change of power in Ukraine as legitimate. And from February 20 to 21, 2014, he even single-handedly ruled Ukraine. After receiving a summons on February 5, 2015, taking an oath and completing a 26-day training course at the Yavoriv training ground, Koshulinsky, together with fellow party members, went to the ATO as an artilleryman in the 44th artillery brigade, in which he served with the rank of senior sergeant. In the same year, he finished his service in order to take part in the elections of the mayor of L'viv, but he took only second place and lost to Sadovyi.Despite losing the mayoral elections, he became a deputy of the L'viv Regional Council and in September 2018 initiated the draft law "On a moratorium on the public use of Russian-language cultural products in the territory of L'viv Oblast". In November 2018, "S14", "Svoboda", "Right Sector", "OUN" and "KUN" nominated Ruslan Koshulynskyi as the only candidate for the post of President of Ukraine from nationalist forces. He was also supported as the only candidate by the commander of the Ukrainian Volunteer Army Dmytro Yarosh, the Kapranov Brothers, the legendary UPA centurion Myroslav Simchych ("Kryvonis") and many other cultural and political Ukrainian figures. Despite strong support and a hard-earned name, Koshulinskyi did not win the election and lost the title of President to Zelenskyi. When the spark from Poltava ignited a real fire all over Ukraine, Koshulinskyi was elected the temporary head of three (de facto two) Galician oblasts, as a compromise figure, which he should be for a few more months, before the full-fledged presidential elections. He has already announced his candidacy, uniting with Marcinkov and other "Svoboda" members of Galicia."

In July, he was again appointed to the position of the head of the Transcarpathian State Administration, which he was before the Collapse. When the Ukraine that the world had known before disappeared, Moskal imposed a state of emergency on the territory of the region, effectively isolating the region from the surrounding world. This helped to maintain stability, but not everyone agreed with it, which greatly affected its popularity among people.

In the 2014 elections, he ran for President and took third place. Since the beginning of the war in Donbas, he has taken a radical position towards Russia and insisted on a forceful solution to the conflict in the East and the severance of diplomatic relations with the Russian Federation. He was also informed of frequent fights in the Verkhovna Rada, conflicts with Poroshenko and oligarchs, or close contacts with Rinat Akhmetov. In 2019, he also ran for President of Ukraine, but again unsuccessfully. When Ukraine began to split, he, taking advantage of the popularity of the Radical Party in Vinnytsia and Zhytomyr regions, and forming a coalition with Yulia Tymoshenko, announced the formation of an alternative government. Of course, coalitions are always a shaky formation, and the alliance of the "Radical Party" with "Batkivshchyna" is no exception, but so far the alliance of the two forces has given the regions peace, security and stability."

Thank to the police system of the so called "state", it, along with the Khmelnytskyi region, is one of the safest in the country. However, such a system also showed significant disadvantages.

Although the results were entirely positive for Russia, Russian President Vladimir Putin decided not to take hasty steps, but the Russian Foreign Ministry recognized the independence of the Republic of Crimea, and Russian troops occupied the peninsula. This was motivated by the fact that the people of Crimea have longed for independence since the fall of the Union, but they never got it.

He repeatedly denied the territorial integrity of Ukraine, called the Revolution of Dignity "a coup d'état organized by the US CIA", after which a "fascist totalitarian state" with "repressions on the level of Stalinism" began to be built. Taking advantage of the collapse of the Ukrainian state, Goblin, together with his loyal fans, crossed the unprotected border and reached Kropyvnytskyi, captured the local regional council. Despite the control over the administrative structures of the region, his power is supported by only about two hundred of his like-minded people, thus making the control of "Dead End" only nominal.

Since his youth, he was engaged in boxing, fencing, knife fighting and practical shooting, the skills of which came in handy in the future. At the age of 22, he graduated with honors from the history faculty of Kharkiv National University and became a teacher in Kharkiv schools. Despite living in a russificated environment, he had quite a reputation among Ukrainian nationalist organizations and even founded his own, "Patriot of Ukraine" (which in the future formed the backbone of the newly formed "Right Sector") and became its commander.

After the liberation of Mariupol by the Armed Forces and Azov, he gained considerable fame and became a people's deputy. He was also often accused of neo-Nazism, although he repeatedly denied belonging to this ideology, both himself and Azov. During the chaos in Poltava, he led local militarized units and, together with the locals, stormed administrative buildings. When the Poltava riots led to chaos and collapse throughout Ukraine, local right-wing supporters of Biletsky elected him head of the region, but the situation did not improve. Poltava region was not an extremely nationalistic region, therefore the power of the right-wing and Biletsky's concurrence mostly ended in local regional centers, And in the villages, often operated autonomous self-governments, separated from the central one. The exception was Kremenchuk, who announced his separation, which was a big blow to Biletskyi's reputation. But despite all the failures, the right-wing was ready to the last to defend the "Motherland of the Revolution" and expand its influence throughout Ukraine, including Kyiv, destroying the governments of "traitors and oligarchs." Some "Azovians", who during the Collapse were not on the front line with the separatist quasi-states, should also help Biletsky in this."
 POLITICS_SERGIY_KRYVONIS_DESC:0 "Born on July 26 1970 in Kremenchuk, Poltava oblast, Serhiy Hryhorovych Kryvonos had a long but successful military career. He served as a lieutenant in the 10th Separate Brigade, was a lecturer at the Hetman Sahaidachny Army Academy, held the position of Commander of the Airborne Forces of Ukraine and proved himself to be a competent and proactive commander during the defence of Kramators'k Airport. A few months before the presidential election, Serhiy Kryvonos was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Special Operations Forces (Syl Specialnykh Operacij (SSO)) of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. He proved himself once again after repelling a massive offensive by pro-Russian separatists with the help of the army deployed in Donbas. However, he was unable to support the government in Kyjiv, which largely contributed to Zelenskyy's loss of power in most of Ukraine. Now Kryvonos finds himself in a difficult position: communication with the government is currently completely cut off, so the army in Donbas is de-facto cut off from the capital. Moreover, a small move in the wrong direction could lead to a full-scale offensive from the other side of the contact line. Whatever the case, the Armed Forces of Ukraine, led by their commander-in-chief, will repel the advancing eastern hordes by any means necessary." He was the main proponent for the creation of "Forces of the special operations"(Syly Specialnykh Operacij(SSO)).Several months before the preseidential elections Serhiy Kryvonos was promoted to the commander-in-chief of Ukrainian armed forces. He yet again proved himself after repelling a massive offensive from the Pro-Russian separatists with the army stationed in Donbass. However, with that he failed to support the government in Kyjiv, which largely contributed to Zelensky losing his power across most of Ukraine. Kryvonos now is in tough position:the communications between the government completely severed for the time being,so basically the army is cut off from the capital in Donbas. Furthermore, a slight move in a wrong direction might result in a full-scale offensive coming from the other side of the demarcation line. Whatever the case may be, the Armed forces of Ukraine, headed by its commander-in-chief will repel the invading eastern hordes by any means necessary."
 POLITICS_PENIS_DUSHILIN_DESC:0 "Denis Vladimirovich Pushilin was born on 9 May 1981 in Makiivka (Makijivka), Donetsk Oblast, and his life path was quite bizarre. From a soldier in the National Guard of Ukraine, to a promoter of well-known financial schemes created by the notorious Sergei Mavrodi, he became the deputy minister of an entire state. After the death of the former president of the Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Zakharchenko, Denis Pushilin became the new leader of the republic. With the support of the FSB, he managed to effectively establish a dictatorship by completely reshuffling the positions in the DPR's executive branch. During the initial instability in Ukraine, his forces managed to inflict significant losses on the Ukrainian army, without making any progress on the frontline. Nevertheless, his position is quite secure. He is largely a figurehead, while the real power in the country belongs to Russian oligarchs, the army and Russian special services and intelligence. As long as they are satisfied with his political position and his ability to run the country, Denis Pushilin's power will be secure in the coming years."
 POLITICS_LEONID_PASECHNIK_DESC:0 "Leonid Ivanovich Pasichnyk was born on 15 March 1970. In his younger years, after graduating from the Donetsk Military School, he worked in the Ukrainian special services and was quite successful in this field. However, having some problems and troubles with the "established" corrupt system of the Security Service and Ukraine as a whole, he resigned on the eve of the massive unrest in Ukraine in 2014. In the same year, he was appointed Minister of State Security of the newly formed Luhansk People's Republic. After the de-escalation of the conflict in Donbas, a new conflict erupted between Leonid Pasichnyk and Igor Plotnytsky, the then president of the republic. In the end, a coup d'état took place, carried out by the armed forces with the support of the DPR. Leonid Pasichnyk became the head of the republic's interim government and was later elected president with Moscow's tacit consent. During 2019, the LPR military, together with the DPR, attacked the positions of Ukrainian troops on the Luhansk front, but with no real success."
