 dnr.32.t:0 "Finale of the integration"
 dnr.32.d:0 "Anna was a simple factory worker from Slaviansk. She had lived in the city all her life and had seen it change over time. But now, with the formation of Novorossiya, everything was different. Anna woke up early in the morning and got ready for work. Outside her window, she could hear the sounds of construction, which reminded her of the changes taking place in her city. The construction of new factories, houses and infrastructure had picked up after the formation of Novorossiya. Anna arrived at the factory and was surprised to see the changes that had taken place there. The machines were updated, the production process was optimised and the overall atmosphere was much better than before. Anna felt proud to be part of the progress and development of her city. During her lunch break, Anna met with her colleagues and talked about the changes in their lives since the formation of Novorossiya. They discussed how their salaries had increased, how the government had invested in healthcare and education, and how their overall quality of life had improved. After work, Anna decided to take a walk around the city. She noticed the new parks and public spaces that had been built and the cleanliness of the streets. She also saw the flags of Novorossiya flying high, and this gave her a sense of pride and belonging. When Anna returned home, she reflected on how her life had changed since the formation of Novorossiya. She was grateful for the opportunities that had come her way and for the sense of community that had developed in her city. She knew that there was still a lot of work to be done, but she was confident that the future looked bright for her and her fellow citizens of Novorossiya."

 dnr.31.t:0 "Connections of Our Roads"
 dnr.31.d:0 "In bustling Donetsk, residents were eagerly awaiting the arrival of a new high-speed train that would connect them to other major cities in Novorossiya. The train was due to arrive in a few hours, and people were already lining up at the railway station to see it. When the train arrived, a loud cheer erupted from the crowd. The train was elegant and modern, with a bright blue exterior and a powerful engine. When it stopped, the doors opened and a team of engineers got out to inspect it. The people of Donetsk watched in amazement as the engineers carefully inspected every inch of the train. It was clear that they had put a lot of effort into designing and building this state-of-the-art machine. After the inspection was completed, the train conductor came out and addressed the crowd. He spoke passionately about the importance of modern transport infrastructure for the growth and development of Novorossiya. He spoke about how this train would connect people and businesses, creating new opportunities and stimulating economic growth. The conductor then invited everyone to take a tour of the train and get acquainted with its advanced features. People eagerly climbed aboard, admiring the comfortable seats, on-board entertainment system and smooth ride. As the train pulled away from the station and sped off into the distance, Donetsk residents felt a surge of pride and patriotism. They knew that their country was at the forefront of technology and that its future was bright."

 dnr.30.d:0 "The news of the war's victory spread throughout Novorossiya, and the streets of cities and towns were filled with jubilant crowds waving flags and chanting patriotic slogans. The government declared a national holiday, and people poured out of their homes to join in the festivities. A large stage was set up in Donetsk's central square, from which patriotic songs were played. The crowd gathered around the stage, and when the music started, people began to sing along. The air was filled with excitement and pride. Suddenly, the music stopped and a man came on stage. He was dressed in a suit and had a serious expression on his face. It was the head of the Novorossiysk government, Leonid Pasechnik. The crowd fell silent as Pasechnik began to speak. He spoke about the sacrifices that had been made during the war, about the brave men and women who had fought and died for their country. He talked about the importance of patriotism, the need to unite as a nation and build a better future for everyone. The people listened attentively, and as Pasechnik spoke, a sense of unity began to grow within them. They realised that they were all part of something bigger than themselves, that they were part of a great nation that had triumphed in the face of adversity. When Pasechnik finished his speech, the orchestra started playing again, and the crowd erupted in applause. The sense of pride and patriotism was palpable, and it seemed that nothing could break the bond that had been established between the people of Novorossiya and their country."

 dnr.29.t:0 "Passportisation Programme"
 dnr.29.d:0 "It was an ordinary day in Kramatorsk, and the streets were full of people going about their business. Among them was a grandmother named Olga who had lived in the city all her life. She had seen many changes over the years, including the recent conflict that had torn the city apart. But today was a special day for Olga. She received a letter in the mail from the government of Novorossiya informing her that she was eligible for a new passport. This passport would allow her to become a citizen of Novorossiya, the new name of the Donetsk People's Republic. Excited and a little nervous, Olga headed to the government building where she was told to go to collect her new passport. When she arrived, she was met by a friendly civil servant who explained the procedure. Olga brought all the necessary documents with her, and the official quickly processed her application. A few minutes later, Olga was holding her new passport with a photo of her smiling face on the cover. Overwhelmed with emotion, Olga thanked the official and went outside. As she walked down the street, she held her new passport tightly in her hands, feeling a sense of pride and belonging. For Olga, this new passport was more than just a piece of paper. It was a symbol of hope and a brighter future for her and her family in a new country, Novorossiya. And with tears in her eyes, Olga knew that she was ready to welcome this new chapter in her life with open arms."

 dnr.28.t:0 "The Meeting"
 dnr.28.d:0 "In a large conference room in Donetsk, the head of the Novorossiyan government, Leonid Pasechnik, sat at a long table surrounded by his top advisers. On the other side of the table sat Yevhen Murayev, the head of the former Ukrainian pro-Russian party Nash. The two men were sitting facing each other, their expressions serious and focused. The topic of their meeting was the integration of local pro-Russian parties into Novorossiya. Murayev began by outlining his party's vision for greater unification of the Russian-speaking regions of the former Ukraine. He spoke passionately about the need for unity and cooperation between the peoples of Ukraine and Russia. Pasechnik listened intently, nodding his head in agreement. He understood the importance of building strong ties between the various pro-Russian parties in the former Ukraine and the government of Novorossiya. He spoke of the benefits of closer economic and cultural ties between the two nations. As the meeting continued, the discussion became increasingly heated, with both men raising their voices as they debated the finer points of their proposals. But in the end, they both agreed on the importance of working together to achieve common goals. The meeting ended on a positive note, with both men shaking hands and promising to continue discussions in the coming weeks. Pasechnik was optimistic about the future of the region and was confident that with the help of Murayev and other pro-Russian leaders in the former Ukraine, they could build a stronger and more prosperous future for the entire Russian-speaking population of the former Ukraine."

 dnr.27.t:0 "Tribunal Under General"
 dnr.27.d:0 "The courtroom was filled with tension as the trial of Ukrainian General Serhiy Kryvonos began. Kryvonos was accused of numerous war crimes committed during the conflict in Donbas, including indiscriminate shelling of civilian areas and the use of prohibited weapons. As the prosecution presented its evidence, the mood in the courtroom grew increasingly sombre. Photographs of destroyed houses and buildings were displayed on screens, and witnesses testified to the horrors they had experienced during the conflict. Kryvonos, dressed in a military uniform, sat stoically as the prosecution presented its case against him. His defence team argued that he was acting on orders from his superiors and that he had no choice but to do what he did. But the defence arguments did not influence the prosecution. During the trial, it became clear that the evidence against Kryvonos was overwhelming. The judge listened to both sides and, after careful consideration, delivered a verdict of guilty on all charges. The courtroom erupted in applause as the verdict was read out. The families of the victims hugged each other and cried tears of relief. Kryvonis was taken away in handcuffs to await sentencing. This trial was a key moment for the people of Donbass, a symbol of their determination to bring those responsible for war crimes to justice. It was a reminder that justice can prevail even in the darkest of times."

 dnr.26.t:0 "Promise of Future"
 dnr.26.d:0 "A large crowd of people had gathered in the great hall of the Novorossiyan government building. The mood was a mixture of hope and uncertainty. They had all come to listen to the leader of the country, the head of the Novorossiya government, Leonid Pasechnik, who was speaking about the future of the nation. When Leonid took the podium, the room fell silent. He cleared his throat and began to speak. "Dear fellow citizens of Novorossiya," he began. "I know that the past has been difficult for all of us. We have lived through years of war and turmoil, but today I am here to tell you that the future is bright. The government is committed to creating a better life for all of us." The audience erupted in applause and cheers. "We will rebuild our country from scratch," the Prime Minister continued. "We will invest in infrastructure, education and healthcare. We will create jobs and economic opportunities. We will create jobs and economic opportunities for everyone. And we will make sure that every citizen of Novorossiya has a say in the future of our country." The crowd again erupted in applause, with many people standing and waving the Novorossiya flag. "I promise you that we will work tirelessly to make Novorossiya a great country," the president concluded. "Together we will build a future that we can all be proud of." As he stepped down from the podium, the crowd rushed forward to shake his hand and congratulate him. There was a sense of optimism and hope in the air, and people began to talk excitedly about the future of their country. For the citizens of Novorossiya, it was the beginning of a new chapter in their history. They had been promised a brighter future, and they were ready to work together to make it a reality."

Moreover, Pasechnik is trying to push the so-called "Donetsk" out of Luhansk. The so-called Interior Minister Kornet is actually Zakharchenko's man. Pasechnik is trying to squeeze Kornet's coal industry - legal mines and quarries - away from him. Recently, on "Rossiya 24" TV channel, Pasechnik, the leader of the self-proclaimed LPR, announced his intention to bring all "state" and non-state coal enterprises of the "republic" out of the shadows. "The policy of approaching state and non-state coal enterprises will be revised to bring out of the shadows those enterprises that are trying to operate illegally. We will do everything possible to legalise them. This is the main task," said Pasechnik. It is noteworthy that this is not the first time that the DPR's special services have tried to take control of certain financial flows in the territory of the "fraternal republic". In fact, it is a struggle between the leaders of the LPR and DPR for control over financial flows from the extraction and sale of coal, alcoholic beverages and tobacco products."

It appeared during the Euromaidan, when Russian President Vladimir Putin introduced the term "Novorossiya" into the language to refer to Russian claims to the south and east of Ukraine, named after the historical region of the Russian Empire of the same name. During the pro-Russian protests in eastern Ukraine in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in April-May 2014, the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and Lugansk People's Republic (LPR) were formed with the participation of Russia. On June 24, 2014, the DPR and LPR announced plans to create the Novorossiya Confederation, or the Union of People's Republics (SNR), and adopted an act of unification. The United Parliament of Novorossiya was created, the speaker of which was Oleg Tsarev, and the draft constitution of a confederal state entity. In the spring of 2015, as part of the implementation of the Second Minsk Agreement, the Novorossiya project was closed, the act on the unification of the DPR and LPR was suspended."
