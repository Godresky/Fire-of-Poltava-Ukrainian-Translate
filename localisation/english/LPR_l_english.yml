 LPR_second_fiddle: "Грає другу скрипку"
 LPR_second_fiddle_desc:0 "In order to keep the economies of the new republics afloat and prevent their bankruptcy, Russia spends about 4 billion rubles annually on both republics. Most of this money goes to the Donetsk People's Republic, which is considered to be more economically developed than Luhansk. This "Donetsk favouritism" has created a sense of hostility among Luhansk elites. There is no doubt that this will continue to deepen the rift between the two unrecognised states."
 LPR_rivalry: "Змагання між республіками"
 LPR_rivalry_desc:0 "After Plotnitsky's "resignation", the struggle for financial flows in the 'LPR' between the current militant leader Pasechnik and the "Minister of Internal Affairs" Kornet did not stop. Moreover, Pasechnik is trying to push the so-called "Donetsk" out of Luhansk. The so-called Interior Minister Kornet is actually Zakharchenko's man. Pasechnik is trying to squeeze Kornet's coal industry - legal mines and quarries - away from him. Recently, on "Rossiya 24" TV channel, Pasechnik, the leader of the self-proclaimed LPR militants, announced his intention to bring all "state" and non-state coal enterprises of the "republic" out of the shadows. "The policy of approaching state and non-state coal enterprises will be revised to bring out of the shadows those enterprises that are trying to operate illegally. We will do everything possible to legalise them. This is the main task," said Pasechnik. It is noteworthy that this is not the first time that the DPR's special services have tried to take control of certain financial flows in the territory of the "fraternal republic". In fact, it is a struggle between the leaders of the LPR and DPR for control over financial flows from the extraction and sale of coal, alcoholic beverages and tobacco products."
 LPR_democracy_shirm: "Демократія?"
 LPR_democracy_shirm_desc:0 "Unlike our Donetsk counterparts, the Luhansk People's Republic has remained committed to democratic values to a certain extent. Although the democratic system in Luhansk is still young, ineffective and at times quite unstable, the government is doing its best and slowly implementing various reforms to make the country's democratic institutions stronger."
