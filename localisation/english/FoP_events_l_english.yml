 war.3.t:0 "Restoration of Order in Ternopil"
 war.3.d:0 "After the collapse of Ukraine, Galicia was formed under the leadership of Ruslan Koshulynsky and the right-wing Svoboda party, which advocated a strong, nationalist state. Ternopil, on the other hand, was proclaimed as "White Croatia" by a group of neo-pagans who gained control of the region.\n As tensions between the two countries grew, border clashes and skirmishes became more frequent. Galicia accused Ternopil of harbouring terrorists and supporting extremist groups, and Ternopil accused Galicia of trying to impose its will on their people.\n The situation came to a head when a group of Ternopil militants attacked a Galician military outpost, killing several soldiers. In response, Galicia launched a full-scale invasion of Ternopil in order to restore order and regain control of the region."

 war.2.t:0 "Volynia Starts Counter-terrorist Operation"
 war.2.d:0 "As expected, tensions between the two new countries quickly escalated, with each seeking to gain an advantage in the region. The Burshtyn Republic was particularly aggressive, using control of amber mines to fund its army and bribe officials. In response, Yuriy Lutsenko, the leader of Volyn, launched a campaign to isolate the Rivne region and cut off their sources of income. \n The situation reached a climax when the Burshtyn Republic launched a surprise attack on the city of Lutsk, which was under Volyn's control. The attack was brutal, with dozens of civilians killed and many wounded. In response, Yuriy Lutsenko ordered a special operation to decriminalise the Rivne region and remove mafia from power."

 war.1.t:0 "Collapse of Confederacy"
 war.1.d:0 "The establishment of the Black Sea Confederation under the leadership of the admiral in Odesa was initially seen as a promising development. However, in the end, the confederation proved to be too unstable to withstand the challenges it faced.\n Over time, the Black Sea Confederation faced numerous internal conflicts and external threats. The different regions of the confederation were deeply divided and often in conflict with each other, leading to a lack of cohesion and unity.\n One of the main factors that led to the collapse of the Black Sea Confederation was the emergence of powerful groups in the country. \n Ultimately, a series of conflicts between warlord groups led to the collapse of the Black Sea Confederation. The conflicts were marked by intense fighting and atrocities, including massacres of civilians. The central government was unable to intervene effectively, and as the violence escalated, the confederation completely disintegrated."

 afu.1.t:0 "On Our Own"
 afu.1.d:0 "After the distabilisation and escalation of civil unrest in Ukraine, we weren't able to contact the government, and aren't sure what is even happening. However, we do know that right now Ukraine is threatened by separatist menace. We must fight on our own until we can re-establish our connection with Kyiv."
 afu.1.a:0 "We have to start preparing."
 afu.2.t:0 "Contacting the Government"
 afu.2.d:0 "After a couple of weeks we finally managed to establish a stable contact with Kyjiv. From what we've been told, political situation is still uncertain, so we shouldn't rely on the Kyjiv administration too much. We don't want to get our hands dirty in their political games."
 afu.2.a:0 "Let's see what we can do."
 afu.3.t:0 "Assessing the Situation"
 afu.3.d:0 "Our high command and intelligence service predict that the colder phase of the Donbass conflict might soon be over. The was with the Russian proxies is on the horizon. It is time that we asess the situation and prepare ourselves to not only deffend against the upcoming onslaught, but also try to end the long-lasting conflict on our terms."
 afu.3.a:0 "Sooner or later we'll have to face the coming storm."
 afu.4.t:0 "Life in the Donbass"
 afu.4.d:0 "The life of an ordinary civilian living in the territory controlled by the Ukrainian Armed Forces is complex and difficult, especially in the context of the ongoing conflict with the Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. The conflict has had a significant impact on the daily lives of people living in these areas and has created a number of challenges and obstacles that need to be overcome. \n One of the key challenges faced by civilians in these areas is access to basic goods and services. The conflict has disrupted supply chains and made it difficult for people to access food, water, medicine and other basic necessities. This can make it difficult to meet people's basic needs and create a number of health and safety risks. \n Another challenge faced by the civilian population in the territory controlled by the Ukrainian Armed Forces is restrictions on movement. The conflict has resulted in the establishment of checkpoints and other security measures, which can make it difficult for people to move freely and carry out their daily activities. This can be particularly challenging for people who need to travel for work, education or other purposes. \n In addition to these concerns, civilians in these areas may also be subject to harassment, intimidation and violence by various actors, including members of the Ukrainian Security Forces and Russian-backed separatists. This can create a sense of fear and insecurity, and make it difficult for people to go about their daily activities without fear of reprisals. \n Despite these challenges, many people living in territory controlled by the Ukrainian Armed Forces are working to build a better life for themselves and their families. They are finding ways to access basic goods and services, overcoming restrictions on movement, and creating networks of support and solidarity with other members of their communities. \n All in all, life for ordinary civilians living in the territory controlled by the Ukrainian Armed Forces can be challenging and difficult, but it is also characterised by resilience, ingenuity and determination to build a better future."

 afu.5.t:0 "Helping ZSU?"
 afu.5.d:0 "A message was sent through the communication line from the troops in Donbas. In it, Kryvonos, relying on the fact that the Armed Forces are still de jure under our command, wrote down everything that we had "owed" him since the beginning of the Collapse. He wrote about thousands of rifles and dozens of pieces of equipment, but our own situation is not the best. We definitely can't send all of it, but by sending at least some of it, we can reinforce Kryvonos' faith in us and make him remain loyal. But looking at it from another angle, he will still be forced to officially obey us, or he could become another rebel. It's not an easy choice..."
 afu.5.a:0 "Send them our help immediately!"
 afu.5.b:0 "We have enough to worry about without them."
 afu.51.t:0 "Zelenskyy Agreed"
 afu.51.d:0 "Kyiv has agreed to provide us with what they can."
 afu.51.a:0 "We are grateful for their help."
 afu.52.t:0 "Zelenskyy Refused"
 afu.52.d:0 "Despite their direct responsibilities, the Zelensky government has refused to provide us with weapons."
 afu.52.a:0 "It doesn't matter, we'll manage without them!"
 afu.6.t:0 "Helping ZSU?"
 afu.6.d:0 "Our government is shaky. In the eyes of most Ukrainians, our government is illegitimate and responsible for the collapse of the state. But despite all this, one person sent us a message - Kryvonos. Recalling our old friendship, he asks for weapons and equipment from our reserves, and we are even able to provide it. So, in theory, we can even get their further support. But despite this, they are still loyal to Zelenskyy's government, and in the future, these weapons may even serve against us! So what should we do?"
 afu.6.a:0 "The present is more important than the future, and no matter what, we must help our brothers destroy the Russian scum!"
 afu.6.b:0 "Who knows where this will lead..."
 afu.61.t:0 "Poroshenko Agreed"
 afu.61.d:0 "Given our old friendship and common goal, Poroshenko agreed to send us help."
 afu.61.a:0 "Maybe he's not so bad after all...?"
 afu.62.t:0 "Poroshenko Refused"
 afu.62.d:0 "Despite our sincere request, Poroshenko refused to send us help."
 afu.62.a:0 "Typical syvocholyi hetman."
 afu.7.t:0 "Helping ZSU?"
 afu.7.d:0 "Suddenly, Tyler's office received a message. Kryvonos, the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, had officially asked him for weapons and equipment. In the message, he assured Shkrobinets that personal conflicts like his with Azov should now take a back seat, and that the most important thing now was to destroy the Russian puppets in the east. So what are we going to do?"
 afu.7.a:0 ""I helped the Ukrainian Armed Forces in '14, '15 and all subsequent years, and I'm not going to stop. Guys! Pack our backup equipment! It's time for him to fight against the moskals!""
 afu.7.b:0 "Despite our best efforts, we are unable to provide any equipment."
 afu.71.t:0 "Tyler Agreed"
 afu.71.d:0 "Tyler, despite our fears, agreed to provide us with weapons, even on a larger scale than we could have hoped for!"
 afu.71.a:0 "I will have to thank him personally one day..."
 afu.72.t:0 "Tyler Refused"
 afu.72.d:0 "Our fears turned out to be true. Most likely, because of our cooperation with Azov, Tyler refused to provide us with weapons."
 afu.72.a:0 "What a shame..."
 afu.8.t:0 "Helping ZSU?"
 afu.8.d:0 "Security reigns supreme in the Kharkiv region. The police are monitoring regional security, and after the destruction of the LPR by Krivonos, there is even less to worry about. But suddenly, the Kharkiv administration received a message from the Ukrainian Armed Forces. In it, Kryvonis informed us that due to a lack of personnel, the Ukrainian Armed Forces were unable to control the entire occupied territory and needed the help of our police units and some equipment. What are we going to do?"
 afu.8.a:0 "Prepare weaponry and personnel for sending!"
 afu.8.b:0 "Tell them that OUR police protects only OUR territory."
 afu.81.t:0 "Avakov Agreed"
 afu.81.d:0 "Avakov, understanding the benefit of the cause, nevertheless agreed to send us equipment and units to ensure control over the east."
 afu.81.a:0 "We knew Avakov was smart enough to agree."
 afu.82.t:0 "Avakov Refused"
 afu.82.d:0 "Despite the obvious benefit to both of us, Avakov refused."
 afu.82.a:0 "We can handle it without this fat prick."
 afu.9.t:0 "Victory!"
 afu.9.d:0 "After the brutal battles for Russian occupied cities in so called DPR and LPR territories, we have finally managed to bring a resolve to this bloody conflict in the east once and for all! The separatist forces of Luhansk and Donetsk are finally deffeated. Even with Ukraine in a complete dissaray, the armed forces of Ukraine stood firm and won against all odds. This is truly a great victory for our nation!"
 afu.9.a:0 "Slava Ukrajini, Herojam Slava!"
 afu.10.t:0 "Victory!"
 afu.10.d:0 "Finally, after five years of ongoing conflict, we have achieved our goal. The last separatist units have been defeated and the glorious Ukrainian flags are flying over Donetsk, Luhansk and other cities in eastern Donbas. It is hard to believe that we have succeeded. So much blood has been shed, so many lives have been broken, so many cities have been destroyed... But we have won. Once and for all. We will never again allow these Muscovite scum to trespass on our land and we will take proper care of the security of the region. My God, there is still so much to restore and do..."
 afu.10.a:0 "Well, let's get to work, gentlemen."
 afu.11.t:0 "Starting Integration"
 afu.11.d:0 "Over the years, Russian propaganda has played with the minds of the locals. Some of them really believe that we crucify children and eat babies... In short, we need to deal with all this immediately. It will take us a hell lot of time and effort, but in the end, we will be able to eradicate this nonsense from the minds of our citizens. We will solve the bureaucratic problems quickly, but the mental ones... Donbas will need a real course of rehabilitation."
 afu.11.a:0 "Let's get started immediately!"
 afu.12.t:0 "Finishing Integration"
 afu.12.d:0 "Ugh, those were really difficult months. We caught all the separatist leaders who hadn't managed to escape, and the locals finally started to realise that they were really Ukrainians. Despite our successes, the full mental recovery of Donbas is still very, very far away. It will take years to really complete the process, at least partially. But we still have work to do not in the psychological sphere. Ukraine is still divided and in chaos, and our new goal is to save the whole country, not just Donbas."
 afu.12.a:0 "Forward to new victories!"
 afu.13.t:0 "Territorial Defence Forces"
 afu.13.d:0 "Following the outbreak of the conflict in eastern Ukraine in 2014, the Ukrainian Armed Forces recognised the need to create a local defence force that could provide security and support in the areas most affected by the fighting. To this end, the Territorial Defence Forces (TDF) were created, a volunteer force composed of local residents who receive basic military training and serve under the command of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. \n They play an important role in protecting the territorial integrity of Ukraine and providing support to regular military units. They are responsible for protecting key infrastructure, conducting intelligence and surveillance, and providing logistical support for military operations. \n One example of an ITT combat training camp is located near Sloviansk, a city in the Donetsk region that has seen intense fighting during the conflict. Soldiers in this camp receive basic military training and then move on to more specialised training in areas such as marksmanship, first aid and tactical manoeuvres. They live in barracks-style accommodation and receive a basic allowance for food and other needs. \n Life in the camp is challenging as soldiers must maintain a high level of fitness and readiness for deployment. They work long hours, and training often starts early in the morning and lasts until late at night. However, many soldiers see their service in the TDF as a way to defend their homeland and protect their communities from the threat of aggression. \n Despite the challenges, soldiers in TDFs are dedicated and motivated to serve their country. They understand the important role they play in protecting Ukraine's sovereignty and are willing to make sacrifices to ensure that their country remains safe."
 afu.13.a:0 "Glory to Ukraine!"
 afu.14.t:0 "Special Operations Forces"
 afu.14.d:0 "The Special Operations Forces (SSO) is a specialised unit within the Armed Forces of Ukraine that is trained and equipped to conduct a wide range of special operations. These can include intelligence, direct action missions, anti-terrorist operations and other high-risk operations. \n The Special Forces were first created in 2014 in response to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Their main task is to support regular military units by conducting reconnaissance and gathering intelligence, disrupting enemy operations and conducting targeted strikes on key enemy targets. \n SOF units consist of highly qualified soldiers who undergo rigorous selection and training programmes. They are equipped with the latest technology and weaponry, including night vision devices, drones and specialised vehicles. They are also trained in a wide range of skills, including shooting, hand-to-hand combat and advanced medical techniques. \n One of the most prominent uses of the Special Forces in the conflict in eastern Ukraine was the Battle of Debaltseve in 2015. The Special Forces played a crucial role in disrupting enemy operations and supporting regular military units defending the city. \n Despite their small numbers, the Special Forces units have proven to be a valuable asset to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Their specialised skills and training allow them to carry out missions that would be difficult or impossible for regular military units. They are also able to operate in environments where regular military units may be at a disadvantage, such as urban areas or difficult terrain. \n However, there are also risks associated with the use of SF units. Their specialised training and equipment make them a very valuable target for the enemy, and they may be at greater risk of capture or injury. In addition, there is a risk of mission creep when Special Forces are used to perform tasks beyond their original mission. \n Overall, the use of Special Operations Forces in the Ukrainian Armed Forces has become a valuable addition to the country's military capabilities. However, their use must be carefully considered and balanced against the risks involved."
 afu.14.a:0 "Glory to Ukraine!"
 afu.15.t:0 "Reform of General Staff"
 afu.15.d:0 "The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) is responsible for planning and coordinating military operations, as well as overseeing the development and implementation of military policy. In recent years, the General Staff has undergone significant reforms aimed at modernising its structures, improving its capabilities and strengthening its role in the country's defence. \n One of the key reforms of the General Staff has been the introduction of a new organisational structure, which includes the creation of several new directorates and departments. These new structures are designed to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the General Staff by streamlining decision-making processes, improving communication and strengthening coordination between different units and branches of the armed forces. \n Another important reform was the introduction of new training programmes and professional development opportunities for General Staff personnel. This includes training programmes in areas such as cyber security, intelligence analysis and strategic planning, as well as opportunities for advanced training and education. The General Staff reform also focuses on improving the use of technology and information systems. This includes the introduction of new software systems and communications, as well as the use of advanced data analysis and modelling techniques for military decision-making. \n Overall, the reform of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has been an important step in modernising the country's military capabilities and enhancing its ability to respond to the complex security challenges it faces. However, much work remains to be done to ensure that the General Staff is fully equipped to meet the country's defence needs, especially as the security situation in Ukraine remains volatile and unpredictable."

 afu.16.t:0 "The Azov Battalion"
 afu.16.d:0 "The Azov Battalion is a nationalist paramilitary group formed in 2014 to fight Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. The group is known for its extreme right-wing views and has been accused of human rights abuses and other crimes. In 2015, the Azov battalion was officially integrated into the Ukrainian Armed Forces as a volunteer unit under the control of the Ukrainian government. \n However, in recent years, there has been growing concern that the Azov battalion has fallen out of the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. This is partly due to the growing influence of nationalist and far-right groups in Ukrainian politics, as well as the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine and the ongoing security challenges facing the country. \n One of the key concerns is that the Azov battalion is increasingly operating outside the control of the Ukrainian government and may be pursuing its own agenda. This has led to fears that the group may engage in activities that are not in Ukraine's interest and may undermine the country's efforts to maintain stability and security. \n There have also been concerns about the Azov battalion's human rights record, with reports of abuse and ill-treatment of prisoners. This has led to calls for increased oversight and accountability of the group, and for measures to be taken to ensure that they act in accordance with international humanitarian and human rights law. \n Overall, the alienation of the nationalist Azov Corps from the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces is a complex and troubling issue. While the group has played a role in the defence of the country, there are legitimate concerns about their behaviour and motivations. It is important that the Ukrainian government addresses these concerns and ensures that the country's security forces act in accordance with international norms and values."

 afu.17.t:0 "Planning the Defence"
 afu.17.d:0 "Our intelligence service suggests that the forces of the separatists are doing manuevers and actively preparing to strike us in the near future. The clock is slowly ticking. Our high command has prepared a plan of a concentrated organized deffence in the key fortified areas,with the continuous preparations for a counterattack."
 afu.17.a:0 "Set in motion."
