 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A terrible fate has cometh upon Ukraine. After the elections of 2019 ,which resulted in a final battle between two main rival parties "The servant of the people" and the "European Solidarity/Petro Poroshenko block" and the chain of events that spiraled out of control led Ukraine,already weak after many political crisises within and on the international stage to fall apart to multiple political factions inside the country,who are fighting for supremacy. Only one will eventually prevail and would be able to unite a divided nation once again,like in times of the Hetmanate. "

 AFU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the elections in 2019, when the country was tearing itself apart, with different political factions claiming the leadership of Ukraine, it seemed like it couldn't get any worse. With Ukraine in turmoil, pro-Russian militias in Donetsk and Luhansk launched a massive offensive against the Ukrainian army. In the immediate aftermath of the major separatist offensive in the east of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense took control of the two Ukrainian oblasts of Donetsk and Luhansk and successfully repelled the attack of incoming Donbassite bandits. The victory was hollow, though, as the army that fought the separatists was unable to help the government in Kyjiv to restore order in the country when they still had the possibility to do so. Now, with communications from the capital basically cut off and the government funding for the Armed Forces gone, the situation looks more and more hopeless each day. With resources shrinking and a fear of an impending invasion from the east seeming inevitable, a great struggle for the Ukrainian Armed Forces and for the whole Ukrainian nation is coming, for the brave warriors to prevail or perish."
 DPR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 2014, after the illegal coup, that took place in the capital of Ukraine, the new government led by Neo - Nazi Banderite fascists wished to genocide the ethnic Russian population of eastern Ukraine, the brave sons of Donbass took their arms and with the support from our Slavic brothers, drove the fascists from Donbas just like our grandfathers in 1945. Donetsk People's republic was proclaimed on 7th of april, hoping to join Russia similar to Crimean scenario. Unfortunately, this did not have to be and the unrecognized republic stuck in a limbo, being recognized only by other unrecognized pro - Russian states in Georgia. Nevertheless, there is still hope. Ukraine is in tatters, and it is our chance to strike against the bloody Kiev regime to liberate the whole Donbass area from the Banderite yoke."
