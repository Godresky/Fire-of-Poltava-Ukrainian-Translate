 AFU_on_our_own:0 "On Our Own"
 AFU_on_our_own_desc:0 "We have found ourselves in a... difficult situation. Rarely in history has it happened that a country collapses into a ton of pieces, having army left to rot alone, isolated, somewhere in the east. Such hopeless situations would often result in hopeless actions, but not from us! We will not bind, will not flinch, will not fall into anarchy, but instead endure, and most importantly, fight!"
 AFU_asessing_the_situation:0 "Assessing The Situation"
 AFU_asessing_the_situation_desc:0 "The state of emergency that was established immediately after the collapse, admittedly, is not very popular among the masses. People can hardly understand that new reality that fell upon their heads, and try to desperately grab some leftovers from the times before collapse, the relatively peaceful times. If we want to not be conquered by russian puppets, we must make our masses understand the necessary sacrifices that must be done. Yes, for now they will have to work much more, spend much less and hope for the best, but our nation of steel will overcome anything. It's for the greater good!"
 AFU_proclaim_a_state_of_emergency:0 "Continue The State Of Emergency"
 AFU_proclaim_a_state_of_emergency_desc:0 "The state of emergency, enforced right after the collapse, has, admittedly, not been very popular amongst the masses. People can barely understand that new reality that fell upon their heads and are try to desperately grab some leftovers from the pre-collapse, relatively peaceful times. If we want to avoid being conquered by Russian puppets, we must make our masses understand the necessary sacrifices that need to be done. Yes, for now they will have to work much harder, spend much less and hope for the best, but our nation of steel will overcome anything. For the sake of the common good!"
 AFU_local_arms_procurement:0 "Local Arms Procurement"
 AFU_local_arms_procurement_desc:0 "If we look around us, we will see a bunch of factories ready to be restarted and used to military purposes. We will use the legacy of Donbas's industry and start manufacturing guns, ammunition, and virtually anything our army could ever need. Kickstart those factories, boys!"
 AFU_harsh_quotas:0 "Harshen the Quotas"
 AFU_harsh_quotas_desc:0 "Unfortunately, there are even more drastic measures left to be done. Since we live in desperate times, we will have to tremendously increase the working hours, decrease rations and impose even harsher punishments for breaking the law. After all, these are wartime casualties, dammit. They must be done!"
 AFU_millitary_administration:0 "Establish Military Administration"
 AFU_millitary_administration_desc:0 "Some time has passed, decisions were made, and now we are much more self-sufficient than we were before! For now, it's our own military state only goal is to bring peace to Donbas. Perhaps we will soon change the way we govern people, but today we have more pressing matters to deal with..."
 AFU_promise_reform:0 "Promise Reform"
 AFU_promise_reform_desc:0 "Those people who are protesting against us... we should try to understand them. We are all human, it is hard for all of us now. After all, we hope that military measures will not last forever, and they may soon be cencelled. We will promise the masses future reforms of our military government, hopefully this will calm everyone down."
 AFU_crackdown:0 "Crackdown On Dissent"
 AFU_crackdown_desc:0 "Our harsh measures were obviously not met with happy faces among the people. Unfortunately, they don't understand the entire situation they are in and are try to demand more freedoms and rights for workers. We need remind to them what wartime law is and show what happens if you break the law in already troubled times..."
 AFU_mobilize_our_forces:0 "Begin Partial Mobilization"
 AFU_mobilize_our_forces_desc:0 "The core of any army, starting with the oldest wars in history, is, of course, manpower. No weapon is useful if there is no one to use it! An inevitable war is on the horizon, and we must be ready! We will enforce partial mobilization to properly expand and replenish our army with fresh recruits."
 AFU_effective_training:0 "Enhanced Training Programs"
 AFU_effective_training_desc:0 "The key to defeating separatists is to overcome their army, and that can be achieved through quality. While their army consist of barely trained militias, ours will now be an army of professionals, the peak of soldiering excellence!"
 AFU_rely_on_militias:0 "Rely On Militias"
 AFU_rely_on_militias_desc:0 "Militias, while being not the best long-term solution, are an incredible choice for our situation. They are much easier to arm, easier to maintain and organize, and much faster to train and deploy. Moreover, back in 2014 the militias proved their effectiveness in fighting separatist scum, so their reputation is already high in our eyes. We would rather prioritize them than waste time and resources on the barely viable concept of a "quality army""
 AFU_reform_the_general_staff:0 "Reform The General Staff"
 AFU_reform_the_general_staff_desc:0 "Leadership and commanders are indeed a very important part of a successful army. We will reform the General Staff according to our needs and our resources to turn our military system into a well-oiled machine of commanders and soldiers."Army, as an institution, most of the time is designed to subconsciously invoke far-right thought into soldiers. Mass dehumanisation of enemies, conservative and militaristic political opinion, promotion of hardline nationalism and so on. Our military system does not much differ from the rest of the world. Far-right thought has been spreading among ranks for a long time now, and we need to take care of the issue. While we surely can't fire all of them, we can significantly reduce influence and structural role of nationalist groups like "Azov". This must stop the spread, but keep our troops moderately patriotic and politically neutral."
 AFU_azov:0 "Sideline The Far-Right Elements"
 AFU_azov_desc:0 "The army, as an institution, is largely designed to subconsciously instil far-right thoughts in soldiers. Massive dehumanisation of enemies, conservative and militaristic political views, propaganda of hard nationalism, etc. Our military system is not much different from the rest of the world. Far-right thoughts have been spreading in the army for a long time, and we have to take care of it. Of course, we cannot dismiss everyone, but we can significantly reduce the influence and structural role of nationalist groups like Azov. This should stop their spread, but keep our troops moderately patriotic and politically neutral."
 AFU_proffesional_army:0 "Proffesional Army"
 AFU_proffesional_army_desc:0 "At the moment, we have done a lot to upgrade and modernise our army. Every day we recieve new recruits, train and arm them, and then send them to the frontline! But it's not a time to relax, not yet. Our army is good only by the standards of the situation we are in, and in fact is barely superior to the separatist military. We need to continue training our boys, deploy new divisions, and only then we will be able to become truly powerful, so help us God!"
 AFU_prepare_for_the_inevitable:0 "Prepare For The Inevitable"
 AFU_prepare_for_the_inevitable_desc:0 "Bold of us to assume that separatist scum have suddenly left their ambitions for Donbas behind. In fact, every single day they revisit their dream of capturing our cities and enslaving our people in the name of the "russian world". Why should we let this happen? Why should we not fight?! Our glorious army will prepare for the inevitable war with separatists, and let it be the last war glorious Donbas ever sees! Slava nam, kozaky!"
 AFU_prepare_the_reserve_line:0 "Prepare Our Reserve Lines"
 AFU_prepare_the_reserve_line_desc:0 "We cannot expect to win a war if we won't build sufficient defense. Not only that, but we will also train our soldiers how use terrain properly, defend the trenches, quickly fortify and much more."
 AFU_now_we_wait:0 "And Now We Wait"
 AFU_now_we_wait_desc:0 "There is no need to rush. We have everything prepared. We are ready. The separatists think that their attack will be quick and unexpected, but this is a mistake. We have been here all this time, waiting, and we don't mind waiting a little longer. Come to Ukraine, russian, don't be afraid..."
 AFU_its_time_to_put_an_end_to_the_separatists:0 "It's Time To Put An End To The Separatists"
 AFU_its_time_to_put_an_end_to_the_separatists_desc:0 "Is there really a need to wait? We have done everything we had to do, and our soldiers are more than ready to crush the traitors once and for all. Moreover, our generals also hold an opinion that a preventive strike would be optimal. We will wipe this separatist madness from the face of the Earth! It's now or never!"
 AFU_reaching_out:0 "Reaching Out"
 AFU_reaching_out_desc:0 "After all, an army is nothing without central command. But we will not be looking for orders, we will be looking for something else that central command usually sends to the frontline - supplies and humanitarian help. Everyone understands that they are needed, but not everyone can provide them. We will test our luck and hope for the best."
 AFU_reach_out_to_kyjiv:0 "Reach Out To Kyjiv"
 AFU_reach_out_to_kyjiv_desc:0 "The Kyiv government is, in a sense, the closest thing to a "legitimate high command" that we will ever get. While they are obviously resource constrained themselves, perhaps they could allocate a few weapons to a good cause."
 AFU_reach_out_to_poroshenko:0 "Reach Out To Chernihiv"
 AFU_reach_out_to_poroshenko_desc:0 "Although we do not swear allegiance to a "rogue president", he can certainly be useful. His army reforms once left a noticeable positive response from both of us. Who knows, if he has any military surplus, perhaps he could help us - from patriot to patriot will weapons flow!"
 AFU_reach_out_to_zaporizhia:0 "Reach Out To Tyler"
 AFU_reach_out_to_zaporizhia_desc:0 "While liberals are not the most patriotic people imaginable, they certainly do not like the idea of their homeland being conquered by russian dogs. Although they have had a rivalry with Azov, such petty conflicts pale in the face of a greater threat. We hope that Tyler's government has become more favourable to the idea of sending us weapons, especially as he has long been volunteering for the Armed Forces, so they will be happy to share their stockpiles!"
 AFU_finish_integration:0 "Succesful Integration"
 AFU_finish_integration_desc:0 "It has finally happened! The separatist leaders are either rotting in prison or in the cold ground, and the former "citizens of Donbas" are finally beginning to recognise their Ukrainian identity! Unfortunately, we cannot completely erase pro-Russian tendencies, but they are now rapidly declining. But the time for rest has not yet come - there is so much to do in our burning Ukraine... "
 AFU_start_intergration:0 "Begin Integration"
 AFU_start_intergration_desc:0 "While we cannot reintegrate the entire region in one click, we can certainly put it on the right track. We will make a list of actions that need to be taken to finally undo 5 years of continuous Russian propaganda and clear the minds of these poor people of separatism!"
 AFU_victory:0 "Victory"
 AFU_victory_desc:0 "Finally, Victory is ours! Separatists flee in panic as the glorious Ukrainian flag is raised over the last city of Donbas. The monstrosities that once were the "LPR" and "DPR" no longer exist, marking the end of a job we have been unable to finish since 2014! However, while it's party time, it's too early to relax. There are too many questions lying around waiting to be answered. Our work is not over yet!"
 AFU_special_operation_forces:0 "Utilize The SSO"
 AFU_special_operation_forces_desc:0 "The SSO, or Special Operations Forces, is arguably the most highly skilled unit of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. They are made up of the best soldiers Ukraine has to offer, and they are engaged in counterintelligence, martial law enforcement and counter-terrorism. The Special Forces will definitely be useful in our fight, and we will use their skills and professionalism to strengthen the army."
 AFU_territorial_defence_forces:0 "Teritorial Defence Force"
 AFU_territorial_defence_forces_desc:0 "The territorial defence forces consist of numerous militia-like units filled with volunteers who have volunteered to fight for their homeland. Their strategic advantage lies mainly in their rapid deployment, but despite the fact that they appear to be cheap, they will still cost us some money. Their deployment is rather an additional measure that is being taken only to overcome the enemy, as the current size of our army is simply not enough. We may eventually integrate them into the Armed Forces, but for now they will remain a separate branch under our control."
 AFU_reach_out_to_kharkiv:0 "Reach Out To Avakov"
 AFU_reach_out_to_kharkiv_desc:0 "A police state that is our neighbour could also be useful - they probably have some extra police equipment, consisting of small arms or light armour. In addition, Avakov could provide us with his police force, which would be useful for suppressing pro-Russian resistance after we are done with the separatists. The Kharkiv government will probably appreciate the help we are providing for the whole region and will help us."

 dnr_situation_in_our_country_desc:0 "Stability is important, and in order to make sure the Ukrainian nazies don't ruin the State, we will need to keep eyes on every citizen and suppress any protests. A state is weak when people are disunited."

 dnr_look_west_desc:0 "The Ukrainian regime has fallen. But the brave sons of Donbass must realize that it's not the end, because victory is not yet achieved. The Armed Forces of Ukraine remain. They continue to fight for the regime that no longer exists, but in that fight we may suffer the most! We will do everything to bury the concept of Ukraine. Or we will perish trying to do so."
 dnr_look_east:0 "Look to the east"
 dnr_look_east_desc:0 "Putin has been called many things. A Politician. A Leader. A Fighter. But for us, it's simple - he is a Father. He, like everyone else, demands loyalty and respect from us, and in return he gives us material and humanitarian aid, leads us into the future, guides us on the right path to become a powerful nation side-by-side with Two-headed Eagle! We shall ask for his help, because right now we need it most, and who else would help us if not Mother Russia."
 dnr_look_north:0 "Look To The North"
 dnr_look_north_desc:0 "The LPR is probably our greatest friend in the current situation. We may have differences or disagreements, but we are all together in this novorossiyan boat! If we don't help each other, how much better are we than Ukrainians? We must ensure military and national cooperation between brotherly republics, because the defense of Donbass is our God-given mission! Forward!"
 dnr_open_old_warehouses:0 "Open The Old Warehouses"
 dnr_open_old_warehouses_desc:0 "Some time ago, gods built concrete and steel warehouses filled with all sorts of weaponry and locked the door so that no one could get it. It is time to open these doors, because we need arms to protect the state, especially from Ukrainians."
 dnr_strengthern_the_propaganda:0 "Strengthen The Propaganda"
 dnr_strengthern_the_propaganda_desc:0 "Not everyone in our country is a citizen who wants to help the state. There is a growing minority of people who want to destroy Donetsk People's Republic, and we shall use all possible tactics to ensure that they don't get the power to do so."
 dnr_mobilize_youth_and_reserves:0 "Mobilise The Youth and Reserves"
 dnr_mobilize_youth_and_reserves_desc:0 "If our children are taught anti-state propaganda, they are no longer our children. We need introduce state-mandated lessons in every school so that our children grow up to be patriots of their state, who will serve and protect it."
 dnr_requestrussianequipment:0 "Request The Russian Equipment..."
 dnr_requestrussianequipment_desc:0 "They have gotten our message and gladly responded to our call for help. We asked them for good equipment that could be used by military, as we aren't int the best position to produce our own."

 dnr_supplement_our_corps_desc:0 "We need to send the newly recieved equipment to the military. Every soldier must have the right weapons, supplies and any possible extras. We cannot afford to make a mistake with this, so we must be careful, otherwise we will pay the consequences.."
 dnr_remember_about_novorossiya:0 "Remember About Novorossiya"
 dnr_remember_about_novorossiya_desc:0 "We must unite in a single union, that would bind the Southeastern states. We should remember this confederation, because this is our goal. If we can, of course. To do this, we have to prepare to defend Donetsk, as there are people who want to destroy it all, destroy the dream of Novorossiya."
 dnr_end_the_trade_war:0 "Set Aside Our Differences"
 dnr_end_the_trade_war_desc:0 "Like any good colleagues, we have our differences. But how important are they on a global scale? How significant are they in the face of danger for both of us? We are the sons of Donbass! We must stand unite to withstand the inevitable enemy, it's now or never!"
 dnr_unite_with_lnr:0 "Unite With LPR"
 dnr_unite_with_lnr_desc:0 "We are too divided and the defence pact is not enough to unite us against the Ukrainian Military Junta. We must unite as a single free nation that will move forward together and defeat Goliath, who only wants to see Donetsk and Luhansk destroyed."
 dnr_prepare_for_war:0 "Test Their Melee"
 dnr_prepare_for_war_desc:0 "We cannot be sure that the Ukrainian Military Junta isn't planning an invasion, so instead we must prepare the united armies to go against the ukrainians.

 dnr_putanendtoukrainianarmy_desc:0 "Our soldiers are waiting impatiently, tanks are pumping CO2 into the air and planes are standing by, waiting for the take-off order. "Go!", the officers shout. The time has come for a showdown between our glorious army, with Russian volunteers by our side, against the Ukrainians who have terrorised us for years. The time has come for a second war for independence."
 dnr_victory:0 "Victory At Last"
 dnr_victory_desc:0 "Victory is here! Ura! We have officially avenged every fallen brother and partially repeated our grandfathers' greatest victory in 1945! What remains of AFU runs away in fear elsewhere, seeing the sheer power of the Russian spirit. And while this is a huge milestone for us, without a doubt, there is still a lot to be done to reintegrate the region back."
 dnr_start_integration:0 "Start The Integration"
 dnr_start_integration_desc:0 "Donbass, though now under our control, is fairly bleeding. There is a ton of things that is needed to be done - from simply rebuilding the houses to reinforcing our new political system in the region and strengthening our grip over the opposition. Hardest was already done, now it's time for us to heal Novorossiya!"
 dnr_passport_programm:0 "Passportisation Programme"
 dnr_passport_programm_desc:0 "People that lived on the Ukrainian-occupied zones, obviously, had their passports and documentations from according country, which are treated like nothing but a paper now. We must help those poor people to integrate into our new management - we will start massive passportisation in exchange for Ukrainian ones."
 dnr_parties_integration:0 "Integration Of The local Parties"
 dnr_parties_integration_desc:0 "Ukrainian-occupied part of Donbass, ever since the war stalemate in 2015, has been a home to many local pro-Russian political parties. In fact, this was perhaps the only region in Ukraine where they got any significant momentum, as shown by the 2019 elections results - only Donetsk and Luhansk regions have voted for Boyko. Now, it is time to integrate our local allies into our political system."
 dnr_increasing_patriotism:0 "Propaganda Effort"
 dnr_increasing_patriotism_desc:0 "The integral part of reintegrating the people of Donbass - is to win their hearts. And though, fairly speaking, a lot of those who lived in the Ukrainian part were already pro-Russian politically, it will not hurt to kickstart the propaganda machine, and let everyone know - Novorossiya is here forever! Ura!"
 dnr_unite_communications:0 "Unite The Communications"
 dnr_unite_communications_desc:0 "During the five years of the "frozen conflict", our infrastructure has become more like a pile of leaky scrap metal. Roads are covered with deep pits, railway tracks have been stripped to the metal, water and gas pipelines have been rusting since the beginning of the conflict, and that's not all. This picture can be seen throughout Donbass. To make matters worse, the junta has deliberately cut off communication routes between the eastern and western regions of our country. But we have won. We are united. Nothing stands in our way anymore. It's time to put an end to the logistical problems and move forward at a steady pace into a brighter future. We will allocate as much money from the state budget as necessary and repair everything that has been destroyed or damaged."
 dnr_promise_of_future:0 "Promise The Future"
 dnr_promise_of_future_desc:0 "For five years we have been thinking about what Donbass will look like after our victory. The situation at the time only allowed us to dream about it, but now, after our victory, we finally have the opportunity to implement everything we wanted. We made tons of promises to the people about the future, and it is our duty to fulfil them. From higher wages to free healthcare. We will prove that our words were and are valid."
 dnr_trybunal:0 "The Great Trial"
 dnr_trybunal_desc:0 "Our glorious army crushed the damn Nazi bastards. Now they will pay for all their crimes against the people and land of Donbass. Most of the Junta's military leadership was captured, but unfortunately some managed to escape. But most importantly, we have Kryvonos, who was too arrogant to abandon his post and escape. He will serve as an example to all those awaiting sentencing. They will all pay. All of them! For our children and parents, they will all die or rot in basements!"
 dnr_final_integration:0 "End The Integration"
 dnr_final_integration_desc:0 "Everything is ready. Finally. After our glorious victory in the bureaucracy, hell broke loose, but we overcame it. All the papers are ready. Novorossiya will now administratively own all the lands of Donbas. The Russians, who rightfully own this land, will once again regain their power there. The President only has to sign the relevant document. Oh, look, it's alredy happening!"
 dnr_elections:0 "Election Day!"
 dnr_elections_desc:0 "That day has come. With the integration of the western regions complete, we have one last big thing to do. The election of the Head of State. Today, from all over Donbass, the capital will receive tonnes of bills with the names of candidates. We will see who will win..."
