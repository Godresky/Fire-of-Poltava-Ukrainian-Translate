 ode.1.t:0 "Important Meeting"
 ode.1.d:0 "Black Sea Confederation, Odesa.\n Serhiy Sternenko, a well-known Ukrainian radical activist, thinks about his own future and the future of the Ukraine. Almost half a year has passed since Voronchenko was proclaimed as the leader of Odesa oblast and the establishment of autonomous government in Mykolaiv oblast. Increased criminal responsibility, control of the press and media, curfews... all this has not let Serhiy sleep for several months. One day he decided to act. Calling up his friends, right-wing public figures and members of "Honor", he arranges a meeting. A few days later, they all gathered in an Odesa eatery and raised the same topic - opposition activity. All those present agree that, first, the situation needs to be changed immediately, and second, they will have two ways to do it - peacefully or bloody. Everyone agreed that no one wanted a massacre. Together, they came up with the idea of forming a political party in opposition to the ruling party and trying to achieve reforms peacefully. Three days later, to this effect, they officially applied for the registration of a new party - (Objednanyj) Nacionalnyj front."

 ode.2.d:0 "Odesa oblast, evening.\n Many hours have passed since the start of the uprising in Izmail, and another one in Odesa region was about to begin. After the rejection of the registration of the "Nacionalnyj front" as an official political party, Sternenko and his colleagues understood that there would be no peaceful solution to the problem. The only option left - revolution. Radicalised activists flooded into the Odesa region from all over Ukraine when it became clear that the nationalists would not give up easily. While Serhiy and his associates were developing a strategic plan for the entire uprising, "Honor" started recruiting locals to join the revolutionary guard. In the end, everything was ready within a few weeks. All that was left was to wait for the right opportunity, and it came. As soon as Sternenko got the information about the relocation of the Black Sea Army units to Budjak, he used his own telegram channel to order everyone to start. It was already dark, so the units of the Honour and the revolutionary guard managed to seize strategically important junctions with much less obstruction than expected. This marked the beginning of what everyone had been waiting for. The real Ukrainian national revolution had just begun...\n Meanwhile, things were getting hot in Odesa. Nationalists managed to cut off the city's communication lines from the rest of the Confederation. A siege had begun. Hennadiy Trukhanov, the mayor of Odesa since 2014, had understood that if the city falls, he, as a long-time enemy of Sternenko and many of his allies, would be the first to lose his head. Having summoned an emergency meeting of the administration and police command, he declared a state of emergency in the city, mobilised local police reserves and gave himself temporary unlimited powers."

 ode.3.t:0 "External Intrusion"
 ode.3.d:0 "After the outbreak of three large-scale uprisings on the territory of the Black Sea Confederation, it is fair to say that the situation had long since gotten out of control. Due to the busy general command and the lack of reserve troops, due to their forced deployment to counter the revolutionaries, the Confederation was left defenceless against the surrounding states. But they underestimated their main enemy - Transnistria. The Russian Expeditionary Corps, led by General Dmitry Zelenkov, has been on its territory since the creation of the so-called "Transnistria" state. Receiving weapons and resources directly from Russia, they are large in number and well equipped. Greedily looking at the southwestern territories of Ukraine since the beginning of the collapse, the leadership of Transnistria, seeing the situation in the Confederation, decided to intervene in the conflict indirectly and use Zelenkov's services. Launching an offensive from the territories of Transnistria, Zelenkov and his troops quickly advanced to the border with Kirovohrad region, taking up combat positions on both front lines, and actually entering the civil war without dragging their masters into it."

 ode.4.t:0 "Fourth Side"
 ode.4.d:0 "It would seem that things couldn't get any worse, but it turned out that the real nightmare was still ahead. Anatoliy Shariy, a pro-Russian journalist and former pillar of Russian influence on the Ukrainian audience, along with Medvedchuk, who has been hiding from criminal proceedings in the EU since 2012, decided to take advantage of the Confederation's not-so-great situation. He crossed the uncontrolled border without any problems and went to the eastern regions of the Black Sea Confederation, where he later planned to revive his activity. Staying in contact with representatives of his own party and former colleagues from the "yellow press", he began to form a new political centre in the Confederation. By promoting ideas that were quite popular among the population, such as the establishment of Russian as the official language or the introduction of complete freedom of the press. Gradually expanding his network, he managed to contact some small local arms distributors and even found investors from Russia who decided to financially support his cause. Eventually, with his accumulated stockpile of weapons and manpower, Shariy decided to act quickly, perhaps even recklessly. By launching an armed uprising in Pervomaisk, he and his loyalists declared the creation of a sovereign Sharyashyaya Respublika, becoming the fourth player in the conflict."

 ode.5.t:0 "Boiling Point"
 ode.5.d:0 "Budjak has always been a land of many peoples. From the times of the Scythians and Thracians to today's ruined Ukraine. You can find all sorts of people here - Ukrainians, Bulgarians, Russians, Nogais, Gagauzes and many others. Back in the days of united Ukraine, local minorities tried to claim their own rights and autonomy, but due to their fragmentation, they were not very successful. But the situation changed with the new Ruin. After the establishment of the Black Sea Confederation, the government could no longer fully control the activities of national minority organisations, and they took advantage of this. A few days after Voronchenko came to power in Odesa region, representatives of the Budzhak national minorities met in Izmail and, having reached a compromise, created a single council to fully and unifiedly coordinate their actions. They then sent their demands, as a single entity, for increased local autonomy to Voronchenko's office, which, realising their combined potential, was forced to make concessions. But as it turned out, this was not enough for them. Feeling actually free to act, they began to covertly prepare for the proclamation of an independent alliance state. And so it happened. At night, unknown persons snuck into the Izmail City Council, took control of the representatives of the Black Sea Administration and waited until morning. After 4 hours, when the sun was already rising, the representatives of the administration were already in the building and a crowd of people had formed outside. They all went to the second floor balcony together and took turns reading the "Act of Independence of Budjak" to emphasise true interethnic equality. Voronchenko was only informed about this by representatives of the Zatoka police department, which refused to side with the new leadership. Voronchenko immediately ordered the redeployment of an army unit to Budjak to regain control of the region. Thus began the Budjak Uprising."
